## Joplin User Guide

## Introduction

Joplin is an open-source note-taking and personal knowledge management application. This guide covers the most important desktop and mobile workflows, including installation on Windows and Android, creating notes, saving notes to the cloud, syncing, and viewing notes online.

### Install Joplin

- Visit <https://joplinapp.org> and download the latest version for Windows.

> Note: Alternatively, install from the command line for desktop builds or use the portable app when available. For open source development, the repository is available at <https://github.com/joplinapp/joplin>.

#### Windows installation

- When installing on Windows, you will be prompted to choose whether the app is available for all users or only your account, as shown below.
- Users can select Anyone who uses the computer (All Users) or only for me (Admin name).

- After choosing the installation option, click the **Install** button.
- When installation completes, click the **Finish** button.

> Tip: Users can also enable the Run Joplin option to launch the app after clicking on the **Finish** button.

> Tip: Use notebooks to separate major contexts like projects, study, and personal notes.

## Editing with Markdown

### Markdown basics

Joplin uses Markdown for formatting notes. Common syntax includes:

- `# Heading 1` for headings
- `**bold**` and `*italic*` for text styles
- `-` or `*` for lists
- `` `inline code` `` for code snippets
- `> blockquote` for quoted text

### Adding checklists

- Create a checklist item using `- [ ] Task name`.
- Mark it complete with `- [x] Task name`.
- Checklists are great for task lists, meeting agendas, or action items.

### Code blocks and attachments

- Use triple backticks for code blocks:

  ```python

  print("Hello, Joplin")

  ```

- Add attachments with **Insert > Attach file** or drag files directly into a note.
- Attachments can include images, PDFs, and documents.

### Save & Sync

- Use **Ctrl+S** to save the current note.

The following screen shows the sync options available in Joplin:

- **Joplin Cloud**: The native, fully integrated sync service optimized for notes and Joplin-specific features. Click [here](https://joplinapp.org/plans/) to learn more about Joplin Cloud.
- **Dropbox**: a general cloud storage provider that syncs your Joplin note files across devices.
- **OneDrive**: Microsoft’s cloud storage service, also used to sync Joplin note files between devices.

- Select your preferred cloud storage option.

> Note: Select the same cloud storage method on your other devices to sync with Windows.

### Syncing via OneDrive

1. Choose **OneDrive** as your sync target in Joplin.
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account when prompted.
3. Allow Joplin to connect to OneDrive and grant the required access.
4. Wait for the confirmation that syncing is complete.

## Syncing Notes

### Configure sync

1. Open **Tools > Options > Synchronization**.
2. Choose your sync target: **Dropbox**, **OneDrive**, **Nextcloud**, **WebDAV**, or **File system**.
3. Enter your account or server details.
4. Click **Synchronize** to start.

### Sync workflow

- Sync regularly to keep desktop and mobile notes aligned.
- Joplin stores note revisions, so accidental changes can be recovered.
- If you use multiple devices, sync after finishing work on one device before switching.
