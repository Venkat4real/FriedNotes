## Why This Guide Exists

Technical writers are increasingly expected to produce more content, in more formats, faster — without sacrificing accuracy. AI agents (LLM-based assistants that can read source material, generate drafts, and in some cases take multi-step actions) can absorb a meaningful share of the repetitive work, freeing writers to focus on structure, accuracy, and information architecture — the parts of the job that still require human judgment.

This guide is written for writers who work with structured content (DITA/XML, Markdown, or similar), publish to a Git-based repo, and want a repeatable, low-risk way to bring AI into their process.

## What "AI Agents" Means in a Docs Context

There's a spectrum, and it matters which point on it you're using:

| Type | What it does | Example use |
|---|---|---|
| **Chat assistant** | Answers one prompt at a time; no memory of your repo unless you paste content in | Rewriting a paragraph for clarity |
| **IDE/CLI-integrated assistant** | Reads your local files, can propose edits, runs in your terminal or editor | Generating a first draft of a new topic from source code comments |
| **Agentic tool** | Can plan multi-step tasks, call tools (search docs, run scripts, open files), and iterate without a prompt for every step | Auditing an entire docs folder for broken cross-references and fixing them |
| **CI/CD-integrated agent** | Runs automatically on a trigger (e.g., a pull request) to check or generate content | Flagging outdated screenshots or version strings on every PR |

Most technical writing teams start with the first two and graduate to the third and fourth as trust and process maturity increase.

## Where AI Agents Fit in the Documentation Lifecycle

```
Research → Outline → Draft → Technical Review → Edit → Publish → Maintain
   ●          ●         ●            ○              ●        ○         ●
```
● = strong AI fit &nbsp;&nbsp; ○ = human-led, AI-assisted at most

- **Research**: Summarizing source code, API specs, release notes, or existing tickets into a working outline.
- **Outline**: Proposing information architecture (task vs. reference vs. concept) based on a rough brief.
- **Draft**: Generating first-pass prose for procedures, API references, release notes, and troubleshooting guides.
- **Technical Review**: AI can flag inconsistencies, but subject-matter accuracy still needs a human SME sign-off.
- **Edit**: Style/tone conformance, terminology consistency, readability scoring.
- **Publish**: Agentic tools can open pull requests, run linters, and check links as part of CI.
- **Maintain**: Detecting drift between docs and source (e.g., a code sample referencing a deprecated flag).

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Drafting from source material
Feed an AI agent your source code, API schema (OpenAPI/Swagger), or engineering design doc and ask for a first-draft topic in your house style. Treat the output as a **skeleton**, not a final draft — verify every claim against the actual source.

### 2. Converting between formats
Agents are effective at mechanical conversions: DITA to Markdown, Markdown to structured JSON for a component library, or restructuring a wall of prose into a numbered procedure with prerequisites and expected results.

### 3. Release notes and changelogs
Point an agent at a diff, a set of merged pull requests, or a changelog file, and ask it to draft categorized release notes (Added / Changed / Fixed / Deprecated). This is one of the highest-ROI, lowest-risk use cases because the source of truth (the diff) is unambiguous.

### 4. Consistency and terminology audits
Agents can scan an entire docs repo for inconsistent terminology (e.g., "sign in" vs. "log in"), inconsistent heading capitalization, or divergence from a style guide, and propose a diff.

### 5. Localization prep and readability
Agents can flag idioms, culturally specific references, or overly complex sentence structures that will complicate translation — before the content goes to a localization vendor.

### 6. Troubleshooting content generation
Given a set of support tickets or error logs, an agent can draft candidate troubleshooting entries (symptom → cause → resolution), which a writer then verifies and slots into the existing troubleshooting guide.

### 7. PR-based documentation checks
An agent wired into your CI pipeline can review a pull request that changes docs and check for broken links, missing alt text, inconsistent code block languages, or outdated version numbers — commenting directly on the PR.

## Setting Up an AI-Assisted Workflow

A minimal, low-risk setup for a GitHub-hosted docs repo:

1. **Keep source of truth in the repo.** Style guide, terminology list, and templates should live as Markdown files in the repo itself (e.g., `/docs/contributing/style-guide.md`). This lets you feed them directly to an agent as context.
2. **Use a scratch branch for AI-generated drafts.** Never let an agent commit directly to `main`. A common pattern:
   ```
   git checkout -b ai-draft/release-notes-v2.4
   ```
3. **Chunk the work.** Ask for one topic or one section at a time rather than "write the whole docs site." Smaller units are easier to fact-check and produce more consistent quality.
4. **Require citations from source.** When asking an agent to draft from code or specs, explicitly instruct it to reference the specific function, endpoint, or file it drew from, so review is faster.
5. **Route through the same PR review process as human-authored content.** AI-generated content is not exempt from technical review, editorial review, and link/build checks.
6. **Log what was AI-assisted.** A simple convention — e.g., a front-matter flag `ai_assisted: true` or a note in the PR description — helps track quality over time and target audits.

## Prompting Patterns for Technical Content

**Give role, format, and constraints up front:**
```
You are drafting a task-based topic for a developer audience, following the
Google Developer Documentation Style Guide. Output in Markdown with this
structure: Title (H1), one-sentence intro, "Before you begin" (prerequisites
list), numbered steps, "Verify" section, "Troubleshooting" section.

Source material: [paste API spec / code / ticket]
```

**Ask for gaps, not just prose:**
```
Based on this source material, list any information you need to write this
topic accurately but that isn't provided (e.g., default values, error codes,
minimum permissions). Don't guess — flag it.
```

**Use it as a reviewer, not just a drafter:**
```
Review this topic against our style guide (attached) and terminology list
(attached). List every deviation with the line number and suggested fix.
Don't rewrite the whole topic — just list the issues.
```

**Constrain scope explicitly** to avoid an agent silently expanding or narrowing a task — e.g., "Only edit the 'Troubleshooting' section; do not modify any other section."

---

## Quality Control: What AI Gets Wrong

Be deliberate about where you place trust:

- **Fabricated specifics** — invented flag names, made-up default values, or plausible-but-wrong CLI output. Always verify against the actual source (code, API response, or a real terminal session), especially for anything with exact version numbers or command syntax.
- **Confident wrong sequencing** — an agent may reorder steps in a procedure in a way that reads fine but breaks a real dependency (e.g., suggesting a config step before a required install step).
- **Style drift over long documents** — quality and voice consistency can degrade across a very long single output; chunking mitigates this.
- **Stale training knowledge** — an agent's built-in knowledge of a specific product or API can be outdated; always ground it in the current source material rather than letting it draw from memory alone.
- **Over-confident troubleshooting content** — causal claims ("this error is always caused by X") should be checked against actual support data, not accepted at face value.

A reasonable working rule: **AI can generate the first 70%, but a human is accountable for the last 30% — the technical accuracy, the edge cases, and the final sign-off.**

## Governance and Review Checklist

Before merging any AI-assisted content:

- [ ] Every command, flag, and code sample tested or verified against the actual source/environment
- [ ] Terminology matches the repo's style guide / terminology list
- [ ] No fabricated defaults, version numbers, or error messages
- [ ] Technical SME has reviewed for accuracy (not just an editor)
- [ ] Links, cross-references, and anchors resolve correctly
- [ ] Content is scoped to only the intended topic/section
- [ ] Any AI-assistance is logged per your team's convention

## Tooling Landscape

This list is illustrative, not exhaustive, and the landscape moves quickly — evaluate against your team's security and data-handling requirements before adopting any tool:

- **Chat/IDE assistants**: general-purpose LLM chat interfaces; IDE-integrated coding/docs assistants
- **CLI/agentic coding tools**: terminal-based agents that can read a repo, propose diffs, and open pull requests
- **CI-integrated bots**: GitHub Actions-based bots that review PRs for docs-specific issues (broken links, style violations, missing alt text)
- **Structured-authoring plugins**: AI features embedded in DITA/CCMS tools or static-site generators (e.g., docs-as-code frameworks)

---

## Metrics to Track

To justify and refine an AI-assisted workflow, track:

- **Time-to-first-draft** per topic type, before and after AI assistance
- **Review cycle count** (does AI-assisted content need more or fewer review rounds?)
- **Defect rate** — factual errors caught in review per 1,000 words, AI-assisted vs. fully human-authored
- **Terminology/style consistency score** (automatable via linting)
- **Coverage** — number of topics kept up to date per release cycle

## FAQ

**Does AI replace the technical writer role?**
No — it shifts the role toward architecture, verification, and editorial judgment. The bottleneck in technical writing has rarely been "typing speed"; it's understanding the product, structuring information correctly, and knowing what's true. AI accelerates production but doesn't substitute for that understanding.

**Should AI-generated content be labeled as such in published docs?**
Generally, no — published docs should read as maintained by the team, and quality is the team's responsibility regardless of how a draft originated. Internal tracking (in PRs/commits) is more useful than a public label.

**What's the safest place to start?**
Release notes and changelogs generated from a diff or merged PR list — the source of truth is unambiguous, the risk of fabrication is low, and it's easy to verify.
